# Lesson 5: Loop

There are 3 types of loop: for, while and do-while

## `for` loop
- statement 1, statement 2, statement 3 might be missed
- we could increase counter with any value, not only increasing 1

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

## `while` loop
```cpp
int i = 0;

while (i < 5){
    cout << i << endl;
}
```

## `do-while` loop
- code block is always executed at least once
```cpp
do {
    // code block
}while (condition);
```

## Note
- using `break` to exit loop immediately
- using `continue` to start next loop and skip the rest code
